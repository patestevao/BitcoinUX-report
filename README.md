# BitcoinUX-report

This is the public report for the Bitcoin UX research initiative, a research effort I've been conducting for the last 7 months thanks to a SquareCrypto grant.

The report reflects my research learnings and is currently "finished", meaning it can still be polished.

If you want to contact me about it you can write to btcuxresearch@gmail.com
